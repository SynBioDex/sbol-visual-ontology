# SBOL Visual Ontology (SBOL-VO)
The SBOL Visual Ontology provides a set of controlled terms to describe visual glyphs that are accepted by the community. The terms are organised based on their descriptions in community-edited [Markdown](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-visual/tree/master/Glyphs) files. Terms are defined for recommended and alternative glyphs in addition to terms to represent generic glyps.

* Base term in the ontology is called "Glyph".
* SBOL-VO terms. Examples include "AptamerGlyph", "AssemblyScarGlyph" and "AssemblyScarGlyphAlternative".
* Properties. SBOL-VO includes object properties such as "hasGlyph" and "isAlternativeOf".
* Annotations. Terms are annotated using properties such as "defaultGlyph" and "recommended".
