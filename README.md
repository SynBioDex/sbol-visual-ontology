# SBOL Visual Ontology (SBOL-VO)
The SBOL Visual Ontology (SBOL-VO) provides a set of controlled terms to describe visual glyphs for genetic circuit designs.  The terms are organised based on their descriptions in community-edited [Markdown](https://github.com/SynBioDex/SBOL-visual/tree/master/Glyphs) files. Terms are defined for recommended and alternative glyphs in addition to terms to represent generic glyphs. SBOL-VO consists of the following items.

* **A base term**. The base term in the ontology is called "Glyph".
* **Terms for glyphs**. Examples include "AptamerGlyph", "AssemblyScarGlyph" and "AssemblyScarGlyphAlternative".
* **Properties**. SBOL-VO includes object properties such as "hasGlyph" and "isAlternativeOf" to define the relationships between different terms.
* **Annotations**. Terms are annotated using properties such as "defaultGlyph" and "recommended".
